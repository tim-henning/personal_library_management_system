<h1>My Personal Library Management System</h1>

<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>I simply built this small system to reinforce some learnings from my university course book.</p>
<p>The system is nothing pretty and basically spaghetti code. But it works and I learned a ton.</p>
<p>I've never worked with Java Swing GUI before, so that was definitly a nice experience.</p>
<p>Not sure I am going to keep working on it.</p>
